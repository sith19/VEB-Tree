Implementation of the VEB tree using the pseudocode from Introduction to Algorithms Third Edition.

Except from the Build tree method all operations on the tree can be done in O(log(log(N)) Time where N is the number of items in the tree

VEB trees represent a mathamatical set with a universe size u where u is the range of integers that can be in the tree

Further modification to this tree will be added to this repo
